Case Study: Predict Mental Health for Young Americans from GSS Data

This is a course project for Generalized Linear Models (Fall 2019) at LIACS, Leiden University. 
We build a zero-inflated negative binomial regression model
to predict the number of mentally compromised days in a month
from ten variables in the General Social Survey dataset
for American residents aged 18-24. Analysis is done in RStudio.
